#  Hey, I’m Duncan 👋,

I’m a **Cybersecurity Trainer and Blue Team Practitioner** passionate about building resilience through hands-on defense, clear thinking, and curiosity-driven learning.  
I train analysts to think like attackers — and defenders who know how to fight back smartly.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

By day, I teach **Digital Forensics, SOC Operations, Incident Response, and Threat Hunting** at Cybershujaa and partner institutions like **ACIC**, the **Kenya School of Government (KSG)**, and the **University of Nairobi**.  

By night, I dive into **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, dissect adversarial behavior, and build realistic lab environments that bridge theory and the field.

My style blends **blue-team precision** with **red-team awareness** — because defending well starts with understanding how attacks unfold.

## 🔍 Areas of Focus

- Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering  
- Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)  
- SOC Processes & Playbook Development  
- Cyber Threat Intelligence  
- Red vs Blue Adversary Simulation  
- OSINT and Reconnaissance Techniques

## 🎓 Education

{{< timeline >}}
{{< timelineItem icon="graduation-cap" header="KCA University" badge="BSc — Information Security & Forensics" subheader="Degree Program" >}}
I completed my Bachelor's degree in **Information Security & Forensics** at KCA University.  
Coursework focused on digital forensics, network & host-based detection, incident response, OSINT, and cyber risk management.  
For my final project I built a two-semester practical investigation and detection system — a hands-on capstone that combined DFIR, threat hunting, and reporting for real-world scenarios.

{{< timelineItem icon="terminal" header="TryHackMe" badge="Learning Labs — Ongoing" subheader="Practical hands-on labs" >}}
I use TryHackMe to practice real-world blue-team skills (and learn red-team tradecraft safely).  
Common exercises: incident response labs, log analysis, detection engineering rooms, and CTF-style challenges that build practical muscle memory for SOC work.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Defense isn’t about fear — it’s about foresight.”

I believe cybersecurity is most effective when it’s teachable, repeatable, and relatable.  
That’s why I focus on **making complex threats understandable** through storytelling, simulations, and step-by-step breakdowns of real-world attacks.

## 🧩 Projects & Experiments

I’m currently working on:
- A **Fake News Detection System** that uses NLP and fact-checking APIs to identify misinformation.  
- **ClickSecure**, a **phishing detection web app** that helps users verify suspicious links before clicking.  
- Periodic **CTF Labs** to help my students sharpen threat analysis, forensics, and detection skills.

## 🕹️ Beyond Cyber

I’m also a **forex trader**, **CTF competitor**, and a fan of minimalist setups.  
My workspace is themed after a **TIE Fighter**, with a color scheme inspired by the **Kenyan flag** — because security should look as sharp as it performs.
