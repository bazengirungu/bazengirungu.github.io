Coursework focused on digital forensics, network \u0026 host-based detection, incident response, OSINT, and cyber risk management. For my final project I built a two-semester practical investigation and detection system — a hands-on capstone that combined DFIR, threat hunting, and reporting for real-world scenarios.\rTryHackMe\rLearning Labs — Ongoing\rPractical hands-on labs\rI use TryHackMe to practice real-world blue-team skills (and learn red-team tradecraft safely). Common exercises: incident response labs, log analysis, detection engineering rooms, and CTF-style challenges that build practical muscle memory for SOC work.\r🏅 Certifications \u0026amp; Badges\r#\rCertificate Issuer Year Link TryHackMe — [Room/Path name] TryHackMe 2025 View Badge [Certificate name] [Issuer name] 2024 Verify [Certificate name] [Issuer name] 2023 PDF 🧠 Philosophy\r#\r“Defense isn’t about fear — it’s about foresight.”\nI believe cybersecurity is most effective when it’s teachable, repeatable, and relatable.\nThat’s why I focus on making complex threats understandable through storytelling, simulations, and step-by-step breakdowns of real-world attacks.\n🧩 Projects \u0026amp; Experiments\r#\rI’m currently working on:\nA Fake News Detection System that uses NLP and fact-checking APIs to identify misinformation. ClickSecure, a phishing detection web app that helps users verify suspicious links before clicking. Periodic CTF Labs to help my students sharpen threat analysis, forensics, and detection skills. 🕹️ Beyond Cyber\r#\rI’m also a forex trader, CTF competitor, and a fan of minimalist setups.\nMy workspace is themed after a TIE Fighter, with a color scheme inspired by the Kenyan flag — because security should look as sharp as it performs.\n🌐 Connect with Me\r#\rGitHub: bazengirungu LinkedIn: Duncan Irungu Twitter/X: @yourhandle Email: duncan@example.com 💬 In Short\r#\rA trainer, builder, and defender who loves turning chaos into clarity.\nMy mission is simple: make security human, technical, and inspiring.\n","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Big Dawgs Eat","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eHey, I’m Duncan 👋,\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"hey-im-duncan-\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \r\n    \u003cspan\r\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\r\n        \u003ca class=\"text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#hey-im-duncan-\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\r\n    \u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \r\n\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a \u003cstrong\u003eCybersecurity Trainer and Blue Team Practitioner\u003c/strong\u003e passionate about building resilience through hands-on defense, clear thinking, and curiosity-driven learning.\u003cbr\u003e\nI train analysts to think like attackers — and defenders who know how to fight back smartly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\r\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003e🎯 What I Do\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"-what-i-do\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \r\n    \u003cspan\r\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\r\n        \u003ca class=\"text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#-what-i-do\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\r\n    \u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \r\n\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBy day, I teach \u003cstrong\u003eDigital Forensics, SOC Operations, Incident Response, and Threat Hunting\u003c/strong\u003e at Cybershujaa and partner institutions like \u003cstrong\u003eACIC\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003eKenya School of Government (KSG)\u003c/strong\u003e, and the \u003cstrong\u003eUniversity of Nairobi\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"28 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Big Dawgs Eat","summary":"","title":"Big Dawgs Eat","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
